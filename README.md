Phrase Hunter is a game that allows players to guess random phrases by guessing letter each characters
in the phrase.

writen language: javascript

I added a little bit of styling to animate the game.

On the start game page.
 * start game button has a shadow to give it a little more depth
 * start game button changes color to blue and the game title bounces when the mouse is on the button.

On the game play page.
 * all buttons buttons has a shadows
 * when there is only one life left the background color changes to red and move from a pale red to a bright red
   to give it a sense of a suspense like a live heartbeat.
